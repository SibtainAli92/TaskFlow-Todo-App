// This is a placeholder for end-to-end testing
// In a real application, you would use a testing framework like Playwright or Cypress

// Test the complete user journey: register → login → create task → view → update → delete
// This would typically be an integration test that covers the full flow

describe('Complete User Journey', () => {
  test('should allow a user to register, login, create, view, update, and delete tasks', async () => {
    // This test would:
    // 1. Register a new user
    // 2. Login with the new user
    // 3. Create a new task
    // 4. Verify the task appears in the list
    // 5. Update the task
    // 6. Verify the update
    // 7. Delete the task
    // 8. Verify the task is removed

    // For now, this is a placeholder as the actual implementation would require
    // a full testing setup with a test database and mock authentication
